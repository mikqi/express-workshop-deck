<a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node (or more formally Node.js)</a> is an
open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment that allows developers to
create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.

---

## JavaScript that run on the server

---

### We can create our own server with NodeJS

---

### Lets start

---

**Simple HTTP Server with Node**

```js
const http = require('http')

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    response.end('Hello NodeJS')
  })
  .listen(1234, () => console.log('Server run on port 1234'))
```

---

**HTTP Server with Node**

```js
const http = require('http')
const requestHandler = (request, response) => {
  switch (request.url) {
    case '/':
      return response.end('Ini homepage')
    case '/profile':
      return response.end('Ini Halaman Profile!!')
    case '/about':
      return response.end('Ini Halaman About')
    default:
      return response.end('404 Page Not Found')
  }
}
http
  .createServer(requestHandler)
  .listen(1234, () => console.log('Server run on port 1234'))
```

### Express is a minimal, unopinionated framework thatâ€™s flexible

## Key Features

- <strong>Middleware</strong> which is a way to break your app into smaller bits of behavior. Generally, middleware is called one by one, in a sequence.
- <strong>Routing</strong> similarly breaks your app up into smaller functions that are executed when the user visits a particular resource
- <strong>Routers</strong> can further break up large applications into smaller, composable subapplications.

```js
const express = require('express')
const http = require('http')
const app = express()
```

---

```js
app.use((request, response, next) => {
  console.log(`incoming ${request.method} to ${request.url}`)
  next()
})
```

---

```js
app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
  response.end('hello world')
})

http
  .createServer(app)
  .listen(1234, () => console.log('app listen on port 1234'))
```
